### Admin controlled Automatic Smart Attendance Recognition System

Python-based facial recognition system for automated, subject-wise student attendance tracking using computer vision algorithms to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

# Project Overlook
1. Admin User interface
2. Data managed by mySQL database
3. OpenCV frontalface Algorithm
4. TimeTable based Attendance management

Project Brief:
To ease the workload of faculty and automate the attendance process, a timetable-based approach is introduced in this work, which automates facial recognition attendance system. The proposed system employs a Tkinter GUI based on Python, ESP32 camera, and ILI9341 display. As the backbone of the Tkinter GUI, the MySQL database system is employed, owing to its strong security and authentication features along with its capability to handle larger databases. This technique is worth using in every software to enhance automation and usability thanks to its faster and more authentic performance. It provides administrators with full control over the attendance system, enabling them to add new users and modify the timetable as needed. It will automatically take attendance within the first 10 minutes at the beginning of every lecture. If a student is not present within the first 10 minutes of the lecture, they will be marked as absent. Therefore, there is no need to take attendance in every lecture. To improve the accuracy of the recognition process, the system uses OpenCV, a widely used open-source computer vision library, and LBP Histogram, a feature extraction method, to improve the accuracy of the recognition process.
The ESP32-CAM is a compact low-power camera module that provides a range of features, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a microSD card socket, making it an ideal platform for developing advanced facial recognition projects. In addition, the system is integrated with an ILI9341 TFT display and an Arduino board to create a user-friendly interface for attendance management. With this system, users can easily enrol their facial data, and the system can automatically detect and mark attendance during the respective lecture according to the timetable, thereby streamlining the entire process. The result is a fast, efficient, and accurate attendance management system that can be used in various settings, including schools, offices, and other institutions.
